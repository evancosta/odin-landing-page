Project: Landing Page

For this project I will be creating an entire web page from a design provided to me.

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors used.

Once I have completed this lesson, I will have demonstrated a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.
